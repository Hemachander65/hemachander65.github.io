![Info.json](/images/Hemachander.jpg)

A 3rd year electrical engineering student with an interest in embedded hardware, robotics, and controls systems. I spend most of my time on campus working away at coursework, working on turbine simulations for Comet Wind, or practicing music. You can find me playing trumpet, french horn, and piano most weeks. These two interests keep me very well occupied most days, but in the rare event of a snom storm blocking roads, being between semesters, or other abnormality, I enjoy working on hobby projects, rock climbing, dancecade games, and playing dnd with my friends.
