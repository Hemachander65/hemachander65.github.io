![Info.json](/images/Hemachander.jpg)

A 3rd year electrical engineering student with an interest in embedded hardware, robotics, and controls systems. While I really enjoy designing circuits and programming, when I need a change of pace, I turn to music. You can find me playing trumpet, french horn, and piano most weeks, though I have limited experience in a few others as well. I really enjoy listening to music too, maybe even more than performing it. These two interests keep me very well occupied, but in the rare event of a snom storm blocking roads, or other abnormality, I enjoy working on hobby projects and playing games with my friends.
